<h1>07/17 Reflection</h1>
<p>After a week of the GWC SIP, I have learned to use and play around with both Scratch and Python. I've seen a lot of similarities between the two languages, including the use of the Core 4. The only difference between the Core 4 in the two languages is that Scratch provides you with blocks (which can either be helpful because of convenience, or can be limiting to your code) whereas Python delves into "real coding." </p>
<p>Today I created a shape-making program which called for a lot of debugging. Debugging is a frustrating activity, especially as you spend an increasing amount of time on one bug, but it releases a satisfying sensation to successfully overcome bugs. The end result of completely debugging a program (usually only for the time being) is worth the build up of frustration.<p>
