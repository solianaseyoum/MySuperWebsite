<p>The four core components of coding.</p>
<h2>Loops</h2>
<p>A loop is a sequence of statements that are repeated up to a desired number
of times.</p>
<p>Below you will find a snippet of a "for" loop and
a snippet of a "while" loop in python.</p>
<p>for count in range(5): <br>
    print(a) <br>
    a = a - 1</p>
<p>while a < 5: <br>
    print(a) <br>
    a = a + 1</p>
  <p> In Scratch, loops are made with the use of blocks.</p>
